{"name":"AnyBlog by Aneesh","tagline":"","body":"Overview\r\n--------\r\nThere a lot of blogging platforms based on Node.js/Express.js.\r\nWhen [Parse](Parse.com) introduced hosting with\r\nExpress, they also had an example blog\r\ncalled [AnyBlog](http://gitthub.com/ParsePlatform/AnyBlog)\r\nthat showcased the same. However, AnyBlog wasn't a\r\npractical solution for a blog. This fork develops\r\nupon AnyBlog so that this can be a viable and easy to use\r\nblogging platform.\r\n\r\nYou can check out the official hosted version\r\nat [www.anyblog.co](http://www.anyblog.co).\r\nYou can check out the demo of my version\r\nat [aneesh.parseapp.com](http://aneesh.parseapp.com).\r\n\r\nFeatures Added to AnyBlog\r\n---------\r\n1. Removed comments. Comments are now handled by disqus.\r\n2. Added tags functionality\r\n3. Added Bootstrap\r\n4. Added share buttons\r\n5. Added CKEditor for a fully featured HTML Editor for blog content\r\n6. URLs have URL slugs instead of the actual id of the `ParseObject`.\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n-----\r\n\r\n1. Created a new app on Parse, and make sure you go\r\nthrough [getting started guide for Cloud Code](https://parse.com/docs/cloud_code_guide#started-installing).\r\n\r\n2. Type `parse new .` in the directory where this\r\nREADME resides, authenticate with your Parse credentials,\r\nand choose the app name you created.\r\n\r\n3. Now, we'll need to configure the url where you can\r\nreach your app. Go to your app's setting page and set\r\na unique subdomain for your Web Hosting url. This will\r\nbe your `shareAddress`. (For Step 5)\r\n\r\n4. Go to [Disqus](https://disqus.com/admin/create/) and \r\ncreate a new site profile. Choose an unique disqus url.\r\nIf you choose `myblog.disqus.com`, then `myblog` is now\r\nyour `disqus_shortname`. (For Step 5)\r\n\r\n5. Edit `cloud/app.js` and specify your `userDisplayName`, \r\n`shareAddress` and `disqus_shortname`.\r\n\r\n6. Type `parse deploy`. This deploys your app to Parse.\r\n\r\n7. Go to yoursubdomain.parseapp.com/blog and view your copy of the blog.\r\n\r\n8. You will see a blank page. Go to to yoursubdomain.parseapp.com/blog/admin to create a new post.\r\n\r\n9.
